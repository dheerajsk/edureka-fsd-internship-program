Nodejs - API (REST)
React - Front End.

Connectionless/SessionLess Architecture.
    - Simple To Implement.
    - Faster.
    - Standard across all clients.

1. Client log in (username, password)
2. Server Authenticates and provide a token to client.
3. Client uses auth token to access secure api.
4. Server checks token is valid, extracts user information from token.
    if invalid/expired-> returns 401(Unauthorized)
    if valid, it allows access.


SessionFull Architecture - MVC.
Ongoing session unless user logs out.
    - Simple Authentication.
    - Secure.

    Problems - Slower, doesnt support all clients.
